0.5.2

  * - Do not read password from wallet, when ssh-add tells us that the former
      passphrase has been incorrect. Fixes an infinite loop, when the wrong
      passphrase has been stored in KWallet.
    - Replace 'password' with 'passphrase'.
    - Thanks to Glennie Vignarajah for noticing both and the initial patch.
  * Wrap Wallet-Object in std::auto_ptr to make sure it is always freed.
  * Add REAME explaining how to use ksshaskpass.

    before.
